    "### Part one\n",
    "\n",
    "A debugger program here is having an issue: it is trying to repair a memory reallocation routine, but it keeps getting stuck in an infinite loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this area, there are sixteen memory banks; each memory bank can hold any number of blocks. The goal of the reallocation routine is to balance the blocks between the memory banks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reallocation routine operates in cycles. In each cycle, it finds the memory bank with the most blocks (ties won by the lowest-numbered memory bank) and redistributes those blocks among the banks. To do this, it removes all of the blocks from the selected bank, then moves to the next (by index) memory bank and inserts one of the blocks. It continues doing this until it runs out of blocks; if it reaches the last memory bank, it wraps around to the first one.\n",
    "\n",
    "The debugger would like to know how many redistributions can be done before a blocks-in-banks configuration is produced that has been seen before.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, imagine a scenario with only four memory banks:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The banks start with 0, 2, 7, and 0 blocks. \n",
    "- The third bank has the most blocks, so it is chosen for redistribution.\n",
    "- Starting with the next bank (the fourth bank) and then continuing to the first bank, the second bank, and so on, the 7 blocks are spread out over the memory banks. The fourth, first, and second banks get two blocks each, and the third bank gets one back. The final result looks like this: 2 4 1 2.\n",
    "- Next, the second bank is chosen because it contains the most blocks (four). Because there are four memory banks, each gets one block. The result is: 3 1 2 3.\n",
    "- Now, there is a tie between the first and fourth memory banks, both of which have three blocks. The first bank wins the tie, and its three blocks are distributed evenly over the other three banks, leaving it with none: 0 2 3 4.\n",
    "- The fourth bank is chosen, and its four blocks are distributed such that each of the four banks receives one: 1 3 4 1.\n",
    " -The third bank is chosen, and the same thing happens: 2 4 1 2.\n",
    " -At this point, we've reached a state we've seen before: 2 4 1 2 was already seen. The infinite loop is detected after the fifth block redistribution cycle, and so the answer in this example is 5.\n",

It then steps forward through the circular buffer some number of steps (your puzzle input) before inserting the first new value, 1, after the value it stopped on. The inserted value becomes the current position. Then, it steps forward from there the same number of steps, and wherever it stops, inserts after it the second new value, 2, and uses that as the new current position again.\n",

    "- 0  2 (3) 1: the spinlock steps forward three times (1, 0, 2), and then inserts the third value, 3, after it. 3 becomes the current position.\n",

    "As you congratulate yourself for a job well done, you notice that the documentation has been on the back of the tablet this entire time. While you actually got most of the instructions correct, there are a few key differences. This assembly code isn't about sound at all - it's meant to be run twice at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each running copy of the program has its own set of registers and follows the code independently - in fact, the programs don't even necessarily run at the same speed. To coordinate, they use the send (snd) and receive (rcv) instructions:\n",
    "\n",
    "snd X sends the value of X to the other program. These values wait in a queue until that program is ready to receive them. Each program has its own message queue, so a program can never receive a message it sent.\n",
    "rcv X receives the next value and stores it in register X. If no values are in the queue, the program waits for a value to be sent to it. Programs do not continue to the next instruction until they have received a value. Values are received in the order they are sent.\n",
    "Each program also has its own program ID (one 0 and the other 1); the register p should begin with this value.\n",
    "\n",

    "snd 1\n",

    "rcv a\n",
    "rcv b\n",
    "rcv c\n",
    "rcv d\n",
    "```\n",
    "Both programs begin by sending three values to the other. Program 0 sends 1, 2, 0; program 1 sends 1, 2, 1. Then, each program receives a value (both 1) and stores it in a, receives another value (both 2) and stores it in b, and then each receives the program ID of the other program (program 0 receives 1; program 1 receives 0) and stores it in c. Each program now sees a different value in its own copy of register c.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, both programs try to rcv a fourth time, but no data is waiting for either of them, and they reach a deadlock. When this happens, both programs terminate.\n",
    "\n",
    "It should be noted that it would be equally valid for the programs to run at different speeds; for example, program 0 might have sent all three values and then stopped at the first rcv before program 1 executed even its first instruction.\n",
    "\n",
